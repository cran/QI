Description: The quantity-intensity (Q/I) relationships, first introduced by Beckett
  (1964), can be employed to assess the K supplying capacity of different soils 
  based on solid-solution exchange equilibria. Such relationships describe the 
  changes in K+ concentration in the soil solution (or the intensity factor) in 
  relation to the corresponding changes in K+ at exchange sites of the soil 
  (or the capacity or quantity factor). Activity ratio of K to Ca or Ca+Mg 
  is generally used as the variable denoting the intensity, whereas, change 
  in exchangeable K is used to denote the quantity factor.
